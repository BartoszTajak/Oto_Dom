## House Price Prediction
The primary objective of the application is to estimate the prices of apartments based on user input and data obtained through web scraping. \
To achieve optimal accuracy, the program generates six regression models and selects the one with the smallest error.

## Models used in the program:
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regressor
3. Random Forest Regressor
4. SVR
5. XGBoost
6. Neural network

## Prerequisites
1. Start a MongoDB database instance
2. Retrieve and store the training data in the directory called `csv_files`. Contact the project's author for further details.
3. Migrate training data to the database:
```bash
python db_utils/csv_to_db.py
```

## Setup
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
Start application
```bash
python3 -m house_price gui
```
